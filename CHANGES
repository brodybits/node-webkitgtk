Breaking changes
================

1.2.0
-----

png, pdf, html functions are now immediate,  
one must call `wait('load')`, `wait('ready')`, `wait('idle')` before,  
to make sure it's in an expected state.


1.6.0
-----
```
on('request', function(req) {
	// use
	req.cancel = true;
	// instead of
	req.uri = null;
	// or even
	delete req.uri;
	// all forms are supported but the first one is safer style
});
```


1.7.0
-----

Load options stylesheet and css are now available only as `style`, a Buffer or
a String, inserted as *user style*.
The reason is to simplify API and also that it is not up to this module to load
data from files.


1.8.0
-----

Life events (ready, load, idle, unload) cannot be listened when next event has
already happened - this is made to prevent waiting for an event that's not
going to happen.
If the event already happened but next event has not happened yet, the listener
is immediately called back.
If the event loop is stopped and a listener for a future life event is registered,
it restarts the loop waiting for the next event.


1.9.0
-----

pdf options replaces {fullpage: true} by {margins: 0}.
