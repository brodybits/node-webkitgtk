Breaking changes
================

1.2.0
-----

png, pdf, html functions are now immediate,  
one must call `wait('load')`, `wait('ready')`, `wait('idle')` before,  
to make sure it's in an expected state.


1.6.0
-----
```
on('request', function(req) {
	// use
	req.cancel = true;
	// instead of
	req.uri = null;
	// or even
	delete req.uri;
	// all forms are supported but the first one is safer style
});
```


1.7.0
-----

Load options stylesheet and css are now available only as `style`, a Buffer or
a String, inserted as *user style*.
The reason is to simplify API and also that it is not up to this module to load
data from files.
